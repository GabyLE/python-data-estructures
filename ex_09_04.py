#9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail 
# messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent 
# the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number 
# of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary 
# using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.
name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
counts = dict()
handle = open(name)
for line in handle:
    line = line.rstrip()
    words = line.split()
    if len(words) <3 or words[0] != "From":
        continue
    counts[words[1]] = counts.get(words[1],0)+1
bigcount = 0
bigword = 0
for key,value in counts.items():
    if value == 0 or value > bigcount:
        bigcount = counts[key]
        bigword = key
